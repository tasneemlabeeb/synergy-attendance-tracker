```

## 📊 How It Works

### **Your Existing IPs:**
```javascript
// These were automatically migrated:
'103.187.94.18/32' → ✅ Active (from code)
'2401:f40:1215:147:...' → ✅ Active (from code)
```

### **Add New IPs:**
```
Admin Dashboard → IP Whitelist → + Add IP Address
```

### **Changes Take Effect:**
```
Immediately! No restart needed.
```

---

## 🔄 Migration from Code

### **Old Method (still works as fallback):**
```javascript
// server.js
const ALLOWED_IPS = [
    '103.187.94.18/32',
];
```

### **New Method (recommended):**
```
Admin Dashboard → IP Whitelist Tab
```

**Your existing IPs from code are now in the database.**
They were automatically imported on first run!

---

## 📱 Use Cases

### **Scenario 1: Office IP Changed**
```
Before: Edit code → Commit → Push → Deploy (10 mins)
Now:    Login → Edit IP → Save (30 seconds) ✅
```

### **Scenario 2: New Branch Office**
```
1. Get new office IP
2. Add through admin panel
3. Employees can mark attendance immediately
```

### **Scenario 3: Temporary Access**
```
1. Add employee's home IP
2. Mark as Active
3. Later, mark as Inactive (or delete)
```

### **Scenario 4: Testing**
```
1. Add test IP as Inactive
2. When ready, mark as Active
3. No risk of accidental access
```

## 🔍 Current IP Display

At the top of IP Whitelist tab:

```
📍 Your Current IP Address:
103.187.94.18 ✅ Allowed

or

103.187.94.19 ❌ Not Allowed
```

This helps you:
- ✅ Verify your current IP
- ✅ Check if you're allowed
- ✅ Know what to add
