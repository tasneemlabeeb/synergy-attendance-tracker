## 🔧 Configuration Details

### **server.js Lines 14-23:**

```javascript
const ALLOWED_IPS = [
    '103.187.94.18/32',    // Synergy Office Public IP (IPv4)
    '2401:f40:1215:147:b823:7a1:4566:8771/128',  // Synergy Office Public IP (IPv6)
    // Add more office locations if needed:
    // '103.187.94.19/32',   // Another office location
];

// For testing purposes, you can temporarily allow localhost
// Set to false in production!
const ALLOW_LOCALHOST_FOR_TESTING = false;
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Still able to check in from mobile data**

**Possible Causes:**
1. ⏳ Render hasn't finished deploying yet (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. 🔄 Browser cache - Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. 🌐 You're using a VPN that routes through your office

**Solution:**
- Check Render dashboard for deployment status
- Clear browser cache
- Test in incognito/private mode

---

### **Issue: Can't check in even from office**

**Possible Causes:**
1. 🌐 Your office IP changed (ISP reassigned it)
2. 📱 You're on mobile data, not office WiFi
3. 🔄 Old code still cached

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're on office WiFi (not mobile data)
2. Check your current IP: https://whatismyipaddress.com
3. If IP changed, update server.js and push again

---

### **Issue: Error "IP not allowed"**

This is **CORRECT BEHAVIOR** if you're outside the office!

Only employees on office WiFi (with IPs: 103.187.94.18 or 2401:f40:1215:147:...) can mark attendance.

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### **View Logs on Render:**

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Click "Logs" tab

   ✅ IP 103.187.94.18 is within allowed network
   ✅ Check-in successful
   ```

   Or (if blocked):
   ```
   🔍 Checking IP: 45.123.67.89
   ❌ IP 45.123.67.89 is NOT in allowed networks
   🚫 BLOCKED: Attendance attempt from unauthorized IP
   ```
