## 🔒 Step 7: Configure Office IP Whitelist (CRITICAL!)

### Find Your Office Public IP:

1. **From your office computer**, visit: https://whatismyipaddress.com
2. **Copy the IP address** (e.g., `103.248.12.55`)
   - ⚠️ This is your PUBLIC IP, NOT 192.168.0.x

### Update IP Whitelist:

**Option A: Update Locally & Push (Recommended)**

1. **Edit `server.js` on your Mac:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/tasneemzaman/Desktop/Attendance Tracker Synergy"
   nano server.js
   ```

2. **Find line 13-17 and update to:**
   ```javascript
   const ALLOWED_IPS = [
       '103.248.12.55/32',    // YOUR OFFICE PUBLIC IP (replace this!)
       // Add more IPs if you have multiple offices:
       // '103.248.12.56/32',
   ];
   ```

3. **Find line 22 and change to:**
   ```javascript
   const ALLOW_LOCALHOST_FOR_TESTING = false; // MUST be false for production
   ```

4. **Save and exit:**
   - Press `Ctrl + X`
   - Press `Y`
   - Press `Enter`

5. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add server.js
   git commit -m "Configure production IP whitelist"
   git push
   ```

6. **Render will auto-deploy in 2 minutes!** ✅

## 🎉 Step 8: Test Your Live App!

### Access Points:

**Employee Portal:**
```
https://synergy-attendance-xxxx.onrender.com/

## ⚡ Important: Free Tier Behavior

### Render Free Tier Goes to Sleep After 15 Minutes

**What happens:**
- If no one uses the app for 15 minutes, it "sleeps"
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- All subsequent requests are instant

**Solution: Keep Your App Awake (Optional but Recommended)**

### Use UptimeRobot (FREE):

1. **Sign up:** https://uptimerobot.com (free account)
2. **Add Monitor:**
   - Monitor Type: `HTTP(s)`
   - Friendly Name: `Synergy Attendance`
   - URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/admin/check`
   - Monitoring Interval: `5 minutes`
3. **Save**

This pings your app every 5 minutes = stays awake 24/7! ✅

## 🔄 How to Update Your App Later

Whenever you make changes to your code:

```bash
cd "/Users/tasneemzaman/Desktop/Attendance Tracker Synergy"

# Make your changes to files
# Then:

git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push

# Render automatically deploys in 2-3 minutes! ✅
```

---

### Problem: "Cannot mark attendance - IP not allowed"

**Cause:** IP whitelist not configured correctly

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Make sure you're on office WiFi

3. ✅ Check you updated server.js line 13-17
4. ✅ Verify you pushed to GitHub: `git push`
5. ✅ Check Render auto-deployed (green checkmark)

---

### Problem: "Invalid credentials" on admin login

**Check:**
- Email must be exactly: `info@synergy.com.bd`
- Password is case-sensitive: `C?18dr!4SYN-attdn`

---

### Problem: Changes not showing on live site

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# If changes are uncommitted:
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push

# Check Render dashboard for deployment status
```

---

### Problem: Build fails on Render

**Common causes:**
1. Missing dependencies in package.json
